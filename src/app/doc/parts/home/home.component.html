</div>

<div class="siimple-paragraph">
    <code>ngx-smart-modal</code> is a lightweight and very complete Angular library for managing modals inside any
    Angular
    project. It
    was built for modern browsers using TypeScript, HTML5 and Angular >=2.4.0.
</div>

<div class="siimple-h5">No external library, no jQuery! ü§ò</div>

<div class="siimple-paragraph">
    To avoid imposing you to download a CSS library by using this package, you simply have to use our built-in
    SCSS/CSS file
    with custom animations and overridable variables. So get rid of being forced to use a CSS library you don't want
    to! In
    addition, it doesn't use jQuery either!
</div>

<div class="siimple-blockquote">
    <strong>But... I'm using Bootstrap (or Materialize, Foundation or anything else)!</strong><br><br>
    Don't panic! We already thought about that! And because we want to be as neutral as we can, we made it very flexible
    for
    you to style it! So if your app uses a CSS framework that has some modal styles, you simply have to pick up its
    class
    names and set the main class in the [customClass]="'modal'" (e.g.: bootstrap). And the rest of the modal DOM
    elements
    has just to be set in the ngx-smart-modal component (e.g.: modal-dialog, modal-content, modal-header, etc.).

<div class="siimple-h5">Features</div>

<div class="siimple-paragraph">
    <ul>
        <li>Handle large quantity of modals anywhere in your app</li>
        <li>Customize the style of your modals through custom CSS classes and SCSS variables!</li>
        <li>No external CSS library is used so you can easily override the modals default style</li>
        <li>Pass data to any modal and retrieve it very simply in the modal view (or anywhere else)</li>
        <li>Events on <code>open</code>, <code>close</code>, <code>dismiss</code>, <code>escape</code> and more for each
            modal</li>
        <li>Manage all your modal stack and data with very fast methods</li>
        <li>Very smart <code>z-index</code> computation (no ugly glitches or problems with a modal inside another)</li>
        <li>A modal in a modal in a modal in a modal... I guess you got it!</li>
        <li>AoT compilation support</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="siimple-h5">How it works</div>

<div class="siimple-paragraph">
    Basically, imagine that the component is based on a service that stores any modals you create in order to let you
    pick
    them up and manage them anywhere in your app at any time.
